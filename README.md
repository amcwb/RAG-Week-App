# RAG App
This was code written for one year of a charity event. This code is unmaintained and PRs/Issues will not be accepted.

The school's name is replaced with a random letter for security.

## Starting
Run the Flask app:

```bash
# Firstly install requirements
py -m pip install server/requirements.txt
# Run the server
py server
```

To run the website (that mimicks an iOS app), just use any generic web app. You must install [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) locally available at `./framework7/` beforehand.

## Technologies
- Framework7 front end
- Flask back-end
- JavaScript logic
